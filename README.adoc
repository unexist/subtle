subtle
------
subtle is a manual tiling window manager with a rather uncommon approach of
tiling:
Instead of relying on predefined layouts, subtle divides the screen
into a grid with customizeable slots (called gravities).
For better understanding, the default config uses a 3x3 grid and maps each
gravity to one key of the numpad. With those keys, windows can be moved
directly to the desired gravity - the same can be done with tagging rules in
the config.
